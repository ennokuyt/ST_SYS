# ST_SYS
Software Testing - SYS Assignment - Lego robot controller

# Did so far:
- Find out which color codes to use for black and white underground
- Robot stops when both sensors hit the black underground
- Let robot turn when one sensor hits the black underground: one wheel goes forward, the other one goes backward
- Robot should turn around its own axle, so the wheel that goes forward has the same speed as the wheel that goes backward
